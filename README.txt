This repository contains two of main exercises we received in the course "Introduction to System Programming" (234124).
The exercises walked us through the fundamentals of the C/C++ languages, using basic containers and generic programming.
The exercises were completed in pairs.
Please take notice that these exercises were our first experience writing in C/C++ (and written while still learning) and as such we were prone to newbieâ€™s mistakes and oversights.
